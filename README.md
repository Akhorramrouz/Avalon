| 8       | 3       | 4       | 4       | 5**      | 5       |
| 9       | 3       | 4       | 4       | 5**      | 5       |
| 10      | 3       | 4       | 4       | 5**      | 5       |
| 11      | 4       | 5       | 5       | 6**      | 6       |
| 12      | 4       | 5       | 5       | 7**      | 7       |
| 13      | 5       | 6       | 6       | 7**      | 7       |
| 14      | 5       | 6       | 6       | 8**      | 8       |
| 15      | 5       | 7       | 7       | 8**      | 8       |
| 16      | 6       | 7       | 7       | 9**      | 9       |
| 17      | 6       | 8       | 8       | 9**      | 9       |
| 18      | 6       | 8       | 8       | 10**     | 10      |
| 19      | 7       | 9       | 9       | 10**     | 10      |
| 20      | 7       | 9       | 9       | 11**     | 11      |
